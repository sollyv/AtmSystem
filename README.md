# AtmSystem
ATM GUI using Java Eclipse and Procedural Programming

Scenario
You work as a software developer, for a software company called Paramount Programming,
which is specialised in developing bespoke computer applications, using a variety of
technologies available.

Assessment Instructions
• You are required to write a program (java class) to create a system for a bank ATM
machine.
• Hard code the users (5) for the system. Each user will have a name, pin, and balance
and overdraft facility. (These must all be stored in arrays.)
• Print out all the accounts details. Include YES or NO for overdraft facility
• The user will log in to the ATM using a method, which should return the position
(index) of the user in the array.
• Once the user logs in, they will have a Display Menu (method) with options to
▪ View Bank Statement (method) (do not display pin)
▪ Change Pin (method) (must be different to original pin)
▪ Deposit Money (method) (print new balance)
▪ Withdraw Money (method) (print new balance)
▪ Exit (method)
The menu should loop until the user chooses to Exit.
• The arrays have to update when the user deposits or withdraws money or changes a
pin.
• The user can only withdraw more money than they have in their account if they have
an overdraft facility.
• There is no limit on the overdraft.
• All integer inputs are to be validated for error checking using a method.
